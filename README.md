# CordTrax-Discord-Bot

## Summary  
CordTrax is a work in progress Discord bot that plays music and has a few moderator functions. It is a personal project undertaken by me to learn Javascript, Node.js, Discord.js and other libraries. It is my first large project, and attempt to take a concept from idea to complete working software. I will eventually host the bot on Heroku for use in my own Discord servers, and for anyone else who would like to use the bot. 

## Adding CordTrax to your server:  
Click [this link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=489652777027633173&scope=bot) and select the server you would like to invite the bot to in the drop down box. Click the blue "authorize" box. If you would like to use commands like ban, warn, kick, make sure the bot has Administrator privileges.

## Commands
The bot has several moderation commands, and some music commands. I will be adding more commands as I go.
