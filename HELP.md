# General Help:  
Throughout this help document, ? is used as the prefix because it is the default prefix. This default prefix can
be changed using the prefix command.

## Getting help with a command:  
To get help with a specific command, type ```?command help.``` For example,
?play help will print the help message for play, assuming your prefix is set to
the default prefix "?".

## Adding music to a queue:  
In order to add music to your default queue, use ```?add YouTube_URL_HERE``` or
```?add "SONG TITLE HERE"``` making sure to use double quotes around the song name.
Your defaultqueue is titled defaultQueue, so when you go to play it, use ```?play defaultQueue```
Note there is no spaces in the queue name. To add a song to a named queue, use 
```?add queue_NAME_HERE YouTube_URL_HERE``` or ```?add queue_NAME_HERE "SONG TITLE HERE"```
again, notice there is no spaces in the queue name and there are quotes around the song title.

## Playing music or playing a queue:  
You must be in a voice channel in order for the bot to play music.  

To play a queue, type ```?play YouTube_URL_HERE``` to play a YouTube URL or
```?play "SONG TITLE HERE"``` to play a song, making sure the song is in double quotes, or 
```?play defaultQueue``` to play your default queue, again no spaces in the queue name, or 
```?play YOUR_QUEUE_NAME``` to play a queue you have created.

## Skipping music:  
If you are playing a queue, you can use ```?skip```to skip to the 
next song in the queue. Skipping when playing the last song in the queue 
will end the stream and the bot will leave the voice channel.

## Stopping the music:  
To stop the bot when it is playing, type ```?stop``` and the bot will leave the voice channel.

## Shuffling the queue:  
To shuffle a queue type ```?shuffle QUEUE_NAME```

## Changing your prefix:  
In order to change your prefix type ```?prefix NEW_PREFIX``` For example, to change
your prefix from the default prefix to ! you would type: ```?prefix !```

When you talk in your discord server, CordTrax gives you XP. In order to check your XP, type
